1. Three snapshots of your Task Board: in the beginning of the first Sprint, in the middle, and at the end of the first Sprint. These must be committed into BitBucket under directory sprint1Docs.

2. I am not able to generate burn down charts for Sprint1 or Sprint2. It seems that for some tasks in JIRA you are not tracking your completetion correctly OR
failed to enter the initial story points when the task was created. 

Mark: 4/5.
